# C Server

Let's learn C by doing something I don't even know how to do in JS hahah

- Create a socket
- Bind it to the server port
- Listen for and accept incoming connections
- Handle errors
- Multithreading

# Set up and run

```zsh
$ make configs # Only if configs were updated
$ make clean && make # Clean is optional but recommended
```
